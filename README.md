# Word-Embeddings-
### Repository contains files with actuall implementation of core 3 word embeddings below :

### 1. Word2Vec
### 2.GloVe
### 3.FastText

Visit Setiment_Analysis/Text_Classification repo to see embedding in action on some End-to-End projects.

For Word level it's very common and usually provide better results with Word2Vec and GloVe . GloVe among all of them proves on some 
complex tasks also . However for character level I personally prefer ELMO or flair instead of FastText as it only support bash commands
and only run on COLAB and most importantly is the overall command control , difficult to use and configure provide less customization with few built-in commands .


##### All the above issues are just an opinion/review for FastText one may can use it , but we should prefer latest research and tools comming out in market ðŸ˜Š
